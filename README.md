# All Tile Start

Extremely simple mod for `Cities: Skylines` to unlock all available tiles at start of a new game. This won't unlock all the tiles when a previous game is loaded. This mod unlocks the tiles without affecting money or milestones.

Works best with "All Spaces Unlockable" 25 tiles mod by S. Klyte, at which point it will unlock all 5x5 tiles. Without "All Spaces Unlockable", this mod will unlock the central 9 tiles. I don't currently have any plans to make this mod work with the 81 tiles mod. Please contact the mod author for that functionality.

Enjoy!

## Troubleshooting

To debug issues you are having with a Cities: Skylines mod, please do the following:

- If you are using 81 Tiles, disable this mod! 81 tiles has this feature built into it, and these mods are not compatible. This goes for most other "tiles" mods as well! This mod does some very specific tasks in order to initialize which may break if other mods perform similar actions.
- If you are NOT using 81 tiles: check your Cities: Skylines log file.
  - Open `Steam` -> `Library`.
  - Right click: `Cities: Skylines`, and select `Properties`.
  - Select `Local Files`, and click the `Browse` button.
  - Navigate to the folder `Cities_Data` and open `output_log.txt` in the editor of your choice.

This file logs all the errors having to do with Cities Skylines. The best I can say is look through it -- I probably wouldn't paste the whole thing here because it may have sensitive data like your folder structure / computer name / username. If you see anything related to this specific mod, let me know in the comments what the error is. The error will be towards the end if you have recently had a crash.

If you have reported an error, but it seems I have gone quiet, it's probably because I don't check steam notifications often. I will, however, see Github notifications, so feel free to post an issue at the source: https://github.com/johnrom/cities-skylines-all-tile-start
